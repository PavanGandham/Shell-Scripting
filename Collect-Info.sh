'''Gather server information within a second
If we have lot many servers and we would like to collect the asset inventory of each and 
every server then it is very difficult to run various commands we have to run in order to 
collect / gather entire information about each server. If we manually run all the commands in each server 
it may require 5 minutes of time for each server where using below script which may reduce your time 
to 2 minutes for 100 Servers wow..!!.'''

# Note: We do not recommend to run this script in any production servers, we strictly suggest you to run this 
# in test or home environment only. This script will come either no WARRANTY with NO support.

# Create a file called systeminfo.sh

touch systeminfo.sh

# copy the below code to above created file

#!/bin/bash

run the shell script file using below command

# sh systeminfo.sh
if you would like to run the same an multiple servers we have to create password less authentication first See Guide Here

then use below to run in multiple server

Write list of server in one file example say /tmp/hostlist.txt

Collect Multiple Servers Information
now create script file and execute

touch multiservers.sh
Copy below code to above created file

#!/bin/bash
